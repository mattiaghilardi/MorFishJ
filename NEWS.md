# MorFishJ v0.1.0.9000

- The reference scale is no longer required for the `Main Traits` analysis. Three options are now available:
  - a reference object of known length -> the scale (pixels / cm) will be saved in the column `px.cm` of the results file as in the previous version;
  - known fish length (standard or total) -> the scale (pixels / cm) will be saved in the column `px.cm`;
  - no scale -> the column `px.cm` will display an `NA`.
- The results of the `Main Traits` analysis are now saved in `pixels` instead of `cm`. If preferred, the column `px.cm` allows to convert them to `cm` when a scale is provided.
